Project Option: Open Project

Our project, Data Dunk, will design and implement a relational database system that takes basketball game, player, and team statistics, and exposes them through SQL queries and a simple front-end making it more accessible for the end user. At the end of the project, we will demonstrate a system that supports schema-based storage of games, players, teams, and statistics, and lets users run interesting and non-trivial queries over seasons of basketball data
